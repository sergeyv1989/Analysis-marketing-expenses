# Marketing expenses analysis

In this project I will analyze marketing expenses for the analytical department at Yandex.Afisha. 

The data is compiled from:
- User visits to Yandex.Afisha between June 2017 and May 2018.
- The orders made during the period.
- The marketing expenses made during the period.

The main goal is to optimize the marketing expenses.

The main steps will be:
- Loading the data while optimizing the data types.
- Exploring the data to learn its contents and to identify issues with its quality that should be addressed.
- Preparing the data for analysis by treating the discovered issues.
- Forming user cohorts based on the ad source they came from and the month of their first order.
- Analyzing the data to find out how people use the product, when do they start buying, how much revenue do they bring, and when does the marketing pays off. The corresponding metrics will be calculated.
- Summarizing the overall findings and producing business insights.
